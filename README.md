# YGO Progression Helper
This project implements a solution to track Yugioh cards for a drafting series such as Cimoooo's Progression series.

This application will allow you to import a .ydk file, listing Yugioh card ids.

The cards will be looked up via the [Yugioh Card API](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) and stored in a file that can be
read by Excel along with the count for each card.
